Puzzles
Maze:
Has an A/B state
Three exits, two of which are visible on the normal path to the key
Must change state at least once to get to any objective from a “start” (start of level or location of key)
Change state using levers located throughout the maze
Dig:
Able to dig up terrain to search for the key
Digging makes terrain a pit, creating a maze of impassable terrain
Must try to leave a path to a door after getting the key, otherwise you need to die to reset the puzzle
Redirection:
Walking along a narrow bridge with flying debris moving perpendicularly to it
Able to change direction of debris to assist in progressing (on a horizontal part of the bridge, for example)
Key is on a section of bridge that you must change direction to reach, then quickly change direction again to escape from
Darkness:
Torches broadcast only light source (along with a skylight from the player’s spawn point)
Staying in darkness for 5 seconds is death
Key is somewhere in the darkness, as are the doors
Can pick up a torch for a 5 - second light source that moves with you, that respawns at original location 10 seconds after it is extinguished (necessary to reach the key and return to light in time)
Pattern:
Tiles flip over in a sequence after a short warning
Key is on one of the tiles
There are “safe” tiles scattered through the area
Friction:
Ice keeps you and objects sliding until colliding with a stone or non-ice
Key and door require separate configurations of moveable stones
Transporter:
Several disconnected rooms linked by switches that teleport you
Key is in one room, doors are in another
Hunt:
Key is being carried around by some creature that moves randomly (or on a set path) and more quickly than you can run
Bargain:
Key is available for sale as soon as you enter the level
Coins are scattered around the level, and are guarded by traps
Collect the requested number of coins, then return to buy the key for the exit
Trick:
Several fake keys along with the real one
Clues as to which key is real
Real key is different each time
